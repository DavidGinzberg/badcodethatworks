# badcodethatworks
A place to demo language features with terrible code that actually works

The code in this repository is intentionally bad (for various definitions of 'bad'), but it compiles and runs and every sample demonstrates some feature or behavior of the language in which it is written. A great example of code for this repository would be java code that uses unicode encoded newline characters to hide runnable statements in (techinically after) single-line comments.

Some of the examples here may be annotated in some way to explain the feature they demonstrate, why/how they work, and why they are bad, but some may not. This is entirely dependent on how much I (or other authors) feel like explaining the code.

These code samples are entirely meant for entertainment purpose. If you learn something new about a language or environment by examining or running some of these samples, good for you, but all I'm really looking for is laughs and/or cringes.
