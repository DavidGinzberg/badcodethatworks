# badcodethatworks
A place to demo language features with terrible code that actually works. This is currently the landing page for [badcode.works](http://badcode.works). Eventually I may build a badly coded (and badly designed) website to better showcase this content.

The code in this repository is intentionally bad (for various definitions of 'bad'), but it compiles and runs and every sample demonstrates some feature or behavior of the language in which it is written. A great example of code for this repository would be java code that uses unicode encoded newline characters to hide runnable statements in (techinically after) single-line comments.

Some of the examples here may be annotated in some way to explain the feature they demonstrate, why/how they work, and why they are bad, but some may not. This is entirely dependent on how much I (or other authors) feel like explaining the code.

These code samples are entirely meant for entertainment purpose. If you learn something new about a language or environment by examining or running some of these samples, good for you, but all I'm really looking for is laughs and/or cringes.

## Contributing

There is currently no formalized process for contributing code here. If you would like to contribute code here you may issue a pull request. Assuming the code actually runs and looking at it gives me a headache, I'll probably include it in this repo; I may ask a few questions on the PR (such as "how the heck do I run this", for [esolang](https://esolangs.org/) samples)

## Uses

This repo is not meant to be useful, it's meant to be funny and make good programmers squirm. It could, however, turn out to be a good source of code review fodder to practice teasing out the purpose/result of unclear code. Your mileage may vary.
